# Business Intelligence Exam Project

This project is designed as an experimental research and development endeavor in the field of data analytics, focusing on the implementation of Business Intelligence (BI) solutions. It involves systematic and creative work to uncover novel, uncertain, and reproducible insights by leveraging modern BI and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies within a specific context.

## Project Overview

The development workflow is divided into four sprints and milestones, each with defined objectives, tasks, and deliverables.

### Sprint 1: Problem Formulation

**Objective:** Lay the foundation of the business case and problem statement.

1. Brainstorm and explore various domains where BI and AI can bring value.
- We agreed that we want to work on data sets, which has the possibility to be predictive and have some coherence for further predictions to be valuable.
2. Choose a specific idea and define its context, purpose, research questions, and hypotheses.
- We figured that merchant businesses are predictive and there are correlating factors to calculate, so we chose a walmart dataset that includes different factors of spenditure and the conditions around these features.
3. Prepare the development environment, including setting up the Github repository, IDE, and software tools.
- As it is we are collaborating on a Github repository. We think we would like to make the exam project as a Python Flask or Streamlit Application.
4. Create a markdown file containing the problem formulation and upload it to the Github repository as the first release of the project's documentation.
- This is the actual Readme for the project.

**Recommended Deadline:** 19/02/24

### Sprint 2: Data Preparation

**Objective:** Collect, clean, and preprocess relevant data.

1. Collect and load data from various sources.
- We as it is only have one data set which we use for the whole project. We have not been able to identify more data sets for complementing the walmart sales data set.
2. Clean and integrate the collected data, applying necessary transformations (ETL or ELT).
- We have checked for null values, used normalization and visualization to figure out which features to proceed with.
3. Explore and analyze the data using descriptive statistics and visualization techniques.
- Box-plot and histogram with normal distribution indicators, quartiles, min and max, as well as describe and correlation heatmap.
4. Prepare the data for further analysis, ensuring its quality, sufficiency, structure, cleanliness, scalability, and informativeness.
- We have picked out some key figures to work onwards with, but it is hard as the features of our data set does not correlate much.

**Recommended Deadline:** 26/02/24

### Sprint 3: Data Modeling

**Objective:** Implement AI methods and algorithms for predictive modeling.

1. Select relevant methods and algorithms for solving the problem.
2. Train predictive or generative data models using supervised and unsupervised methods, neural networks, LLMs, or graphs.
3. Apply appropriate inference measures to assess model quality and test hypotheses.
4. Test, validate, and iterate models for improvement.

**Recommended Deadline:** 11/03/24

### Stage 4: Solution Explainability and Usability Evaluation

**Objective:** Present analysis results in a human-understandable form.

1. Visualize data, analysis process, methods, and usage scenarios.
2. Create a simple visual interface for the application.
3. Conduct usability evaluation with potential users and incorporate feedback.
4. Revise, complete, and deliver the final solution to Github and Wiseflow.

**Recommended Deadline:** 14/03/24

## Notes

- This is a group project, ideally with 2-3 students.
- The exam is individual, with grading based on both group project and individual performance.
- The project solution on Github should include problem statement, motivation, theoretical foundation, choices, design, code, outcomes, and implementation instructions.
- Reproduction of project functionality and results is crucial for assessment.
